### “Automatic Detection of Face Touch and Self-adaptors in Infants”
This repository provides a framework for extracting, processing and classifying face touches in infants.
A demo explaining all the main characteristics of the code can be seen in the file "Demo_Predicting_Face_Touches.ipynb".

## Citation
This code has used existing implementations of OpenPose for infants, 3D-FAN and MediaPipe to support in the detection and classification of the face touches.
